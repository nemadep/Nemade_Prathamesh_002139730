## Assignment 1
Your task is to build a java application that will allow a user to create a personal profile and then display. Please refer to Lab 1 video(which has been posted on Microsoft Teams - Announcement channel) the results. The two use cases are:

- Create a person profile
- Display a person profile
In this exercise, you are to define a person's class with the following personal attributes.

- Name
- Geographic data
- Date of birth
- Telephone numbers
- FAX number
- Email addresses
- Social Security number
- Medical record number
- Health plan beneficiary number
- Bank account numbers
- Certificate/license number
- Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers including license plates
- Device identifiers and serial numbers
- LinkedIn
- Internet protocol addresses
- Biometric identifiers (i.e. retinal scan, fingerprints)
- Full face photos and comparable images
- Any unique identifying number, characteristic, or code
Notes:
- The photo image of the person is required.



## Assignment 2

The objective of this assignment is to practice managing a group of objects from creation, update, and search perspectives. In addition, you are to learn how to convert user questions to attributes on the classes, and real answers on the screen. Some of the search functions require that you find multiple instances that satisfy the search criteria. The matched elements must be collected into temporary array lists to display on the screen in a secondary table. Write an application to manage a fleet of cars for Uber in a certain geo-area. Your application should enable search to answer the following questions:

Find me the first available passenger car.
How many cars are currently available. How many are not.
List all cars that are made by Toyota, GM, etc.
List all cars that were manufactured in a given year, ‘x’.
List all cars with a minimum of x seats but no more than y seats.
Find a car with the given serial number. List the attributes of the found car.
List all cars given the model number.
List all the car manufacturers used by the (this) Uber.
When was the last time the fleet catalog was updated.
List all cars that are available in a given city.
List all cars that have expired maintenance certificate.
 

Your application must enable the creation and update functions for any of the attributes of concern. It will be okay to assume each of these questions is a button on the left/right side of the screen depending on your design. Also, a configuration file enables the creation of multiple instances of cars with various characteristics consistent with the requirements above. This will save you from having to retype the same thing multiple times. Make sure to create enough variations to enable a good demo of your solution. Checkboxes should be used to indicate yes or no answers to certain attributes such as availability, etc. The ability to update some of these attributes is required as well.

The UI design will be considered in grades.

Data Validation Requirements:

Not-null check. Some attributes of cars used for creating & updating cannot be null.
Some attributes should be unique.


## Assignment 3
 The objective of this assignment is to instill in you the techniques for turning an object model into a machine for information gathering and data aggregation. We want to use software engineering techniques to improve the quality of education anywhere and hold people accountable for improving the quality of life through education, learning to learn, and feedback. Your task is to study ways to create a performance measurement solution to enable universities to measure the quality of the education they deliver to their students. The approach will be to look into how an

educational system in terms of faculty and courses contribute to the growth of their graduates over a 5-year period. You must figure out ways to track the jobs and promotions graduates get over time and assign rankings accordingly. In addition, track the connection of courses and their relevance to graduates' growth.

One of your deliverables will be to design a dashboard that enables college and university administrators to compare the performance of their academic units. One additional question is to consider ways to define your own ranking system for students to decide where they want to go for their studies. The current system is biased toward research.

Deliverables

Report outlining your proposed solution.
Sequence diagrams showing how to navigate the university object model to deliver performance metrics needed for performance and feedback.
A class diagram showing the changes to the university model to support the new capabilities. This diagram must include the additional methods and attributes required to deliver the results.
